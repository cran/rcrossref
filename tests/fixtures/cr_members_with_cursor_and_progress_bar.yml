        the microscopic pore structures of tight sandstones is becoming one of the
        most challenging efforts, and the strong heterogeneity makes the accurate
        assessment still a problem. In this research, we report a new criterion for
        pore structure typing based on the fractal geometry theory. The fractal dimension
        values were first accurately calculated through intrusion and nonintrusion
        methods. The results show that the pores in tight sandstones have multifractal
        distributions and different types of pore structure were divided based on
        various tests. The relationships between petrophysical properties and a series
        of multifractal parameters have been analyzed in detail. The fractal dimension
        values of type 1 sandstones derived from the throat curves in rate-controlled
        mercury intrusion methods can well characterize the porosity of the research
        area, while the others did not respond well. Finally, a multifractal criterion
        was proposed to analyze the petrological and pore structures by combined observations
        and experiments. The new criterion exhibits perfect performance in the prediction
        of the storage capacity. The multifractal model proposed in this research
        helps to assess the pore structures of tight sandstones and helps to characterize
        the reservoir quality in hydrocarbon exploration and development.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/6463473","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,5]],"date-time":"2019-11-05T18:32:01Z","timestamp":1572978721000},"page":"1-19","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Quantifying

        To investigate the effect of sevoflurane on the monophasic action potentials
        (MAPs) in isolated rat hearts after ischemia-reperfusion. <jats:italic>Methods<\/jats:italic>.
        Twenty-four healthy SD male rats, weighing 280\u2013320\u2009g, were randomly
        divided into three groups after successful preparation of a Langendorff isolated
        heart perfusion model with a stabilization period perfusion of 15\u2009min
        with Krebs\u2013Henseleit (K\u2013H) fluid (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u20098):
        the control group (group A, continuously perfused with K\u2013H fluid for
        105\u2009min), the ischemia-reperfusion group (group B, continuously perfused
        with K\u2013H fluid for 15\u2009min, and then exposed to 60\u2009min of global
        ischemia induced by Thomas solution followed by 30\u2009min of reperfusion),
        and the sevoflurane group (group C, K\u2013H fluid contained 1.0 MAC sevoflurane,
        and other procedures were same as in group B). Heart rate (HR) and MAPs including
        time course (MAPD<jats:sub>50<\/jats:sub> or MAPD<jats:sub>90<\/jats:sub>)
        of the epicardium (Epi) and endocardium (Endo) were recorded at the time of
        balance perfusion for 15\u2009min (<jats:italic>T<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>0<\/jats:sub>),
        continuous perfusion for 15\u2009min (<jats:italic>T<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>1<\/jats:sub>),
        reperfusion for 15\u2009min\/continuous perfusion for 105\u2009min (<jats:italic>T<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>),
        and reperfusion for 30\u2009min\/continuous perfusion for 120\u2009min (<jats:italic>T<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>),
        and the transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) was calculated. The
        incidence of arrhythmia, time for restoration of spontaneous heart beat, and
        duration of arrhythmia were recorded during the period of reperfusion. <jats:italic>Results<\/jats:italic>.
        HR in group B and group C was lower at <jats:italic>T<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>

        The prolonged MAPD<jats:sub>90<\/jats:sub> at <jats:italic>T<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>
        and <jats:italic>T<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub> in group B strikingly

        report a heterojunction photocatalyst by coupling CdS with Bi12O17Cl2 via
        a facile thermal annealing process. Such heterostructure can promote the charge
        separation between CdS and Bi12O17Cl2, thereby leading to a considerable improvement
        on the performance for CO2 reduction into valuable CH4 and phenol conversion
        under visible light exposure. The CdS\/Bi12O17Cl2 heterojunction with mass
        ratio of 1\u2009:\u20091 (50% CdS\/Bi12O17Cl2) shows the highest CH4 production
        rate (1.28\u2009\u03bcmol\u00b7h-1\u00b7g-1), which is as 9.8 and 5.8 times
        as the CH4 generation rate of pure Bi12O17Cl2 and CdS (0.13 and 0.22\u2009\u03bcmol\u00b7h-1\u00b7g-1),
        respectively. Also, the 50% CdS\/Bi12O17Cl2 sample shows the highest activity
        of phenol conversion with a conversion ratio of 92%, which is as 2.2 times
        and 1.9 times as the conversion ratio of pristine Bi12O17Cl2 (41%) and CdS
        (48%), respectively. The present study demonstrates the great potential of
        the CdS\/Bi12O17Cl2 heterojunction for efficient charge separation towards
        increased photocatalytic CH4 production and phenol conversion.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/3059385","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,22]],"date-time":"2022-01-22T20:50:12Z","timestamp":1642884612000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["CdS\/Bi12O17Cl2

        Although numerous studies have looked at the numeric rating scale (NRS) in
        chronic pain patients and several studies have evaluated objective pain scales,
        no known studies have assessed an objective pain scale for use in the evaluation
        of adult chronic pain patients in the outpatient setting. Subjective scales
        require patients to convert a subjective feeling into a quantitative number.
        Meanwhile, objective pain scales utilize, for the most part, the patient\u2019s
        behavioral component as observed by the provider in addition to the patient\u2019s
        subjective perception of pain. This study aims to examine the reliability
        and validity of an objective Chronic Pain Behavioral Pain Scale for Adults
        (CBPS) as compared to the traditional NRS. Methods. In this cross-sectional
        study, patients were assessed before and after an interventional pain procedure
        by a researcher and a nurse using the CBPS and the NRS. Interrater reliability,
        concurrent validity, and construct validity were analyzed. Results. Interrater
        reliability revealed a fair-good agreement between the nurse\u2019s and researcher\u2019s
        CBPS scores, weighted kappa values of 0.59 and 0.65, preprocedure and postprocedure,
        respectively. Concurrent validity showed low positive correlation for the
        preprocedure measurements, 0.34 (95% CI 0.16\u20130.50) and 0.47 (95% CI 0.31\u20130.61),
        and moderate positive correlation for the postprocedure measurements, 0.68
        (95% CI 0.56\u20130.77) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.55\u20130.77), for the nurses and
        researchers, respectively. Construct validity demonstrated an equally average
        significant reduction in pain from preprocedure to postprocedure, CBPS and
        NRS median (IQR) scores preprocedure (4 (2\u20136) and 6 (4\u20138)) and postprocedure
        (1 (0\u20132) and 3 (0\u20135)), <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        Discussion. The CBPS has been shown to have interrater reliability, concurrent
        validity, and construct validity. However, further testing is needed to show
        its potential benefits over other pain scales and its effectiveness in treating

        review some recent progress in studying the nuclear physics especially nucleon-nucleon
        (NN) force within the gauge-gravity duality, in context of noncritical string
        theory. Our main focus is on the holographic QCD model based on the AdS<jats:sub>6<\/jats:sub>background.
        We explain the noncritical holography model and obtain the vector-meson spectrum
        and pion decay constant. Also, we study the NN interaction in this frame and
        calculate the nucleonmeson coupling constants. A further topic covered is
        a toy model for calculating the light nuclei potential. In particular, we
        calculate the light nuclei binding energies and also excited energies of some
        available excited states. We compare our results with the results of other
        nuclear models and also with the experimental data. Moreover, we describe
        some other issues which are studied using the gauge-gravity duality.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/863268","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,30]],"date-time":"2014-04-30T17:05:22Z","timestamp":1398877522000},"page":"1-19","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Application

        present models for bartering of resources on grids. Bartering models can be
        useful for making resource allocation decisions in grids and perhaps even
        for building a so called barter grid whereby distributed resources such as
        electronic media can be bartered. Grids allow various resources to be shared
        among many users. This sharing however definitely does not mean that everyone
        will have unrestricted use of the resources. Some mechanism such as pricing
        or quotas can be employed in order to enforce controlled sharing of resources.
        A barter model for resource sharing can enable people or computer centers
        to directly get something in return for letting their resources to be used
        by others. We utilize directed hypergraphs to develop a barter model in which
        multiple resources can be traded. We prove that the decision version of the
        multi-resource bartering problem is NP-complete. We present an integer programming
        formulation for the bartering problem. We also present a linear time algorithm
        to compute components that may contain feasible bartering solutions. We generalize
        our multi-resource bartering formulation to the case where multiple instances
        of resources are present. Finally, we present various computational results
        from our software that makes use of LP_SOLVE and CPLEX mixed integer programming

        proliferation is critical to the outgrowth of biological structures including
        the face and limbs. This cellular process has traditionally been studied via
        sequential histological sampling of these tissues. The length and tedium of
        traditional sampling is a major impediment to analyzing the large datasets
        required to accurately model cellular processes. Computerized cell localization
        and quantification is critical for high-throughput morphometric analysis of
        developing embryonic tissues. We have developed the Incremental Cell Search
        (ICS), a novel software tool that expedites the analysis of relationships
        between morphological outgrowth and cell proliferation in embryonic tissues.
        Based on an estimated average cell size and stain color, ICS rapidly indicates
        the approximate location and amount of cells in histological images of labeled
        embryonic tissue and provides estimates of cell counts in regions with saturated
        fluorescence and blurred cell boundaries. This capacity opens the door to

        Geometric constraints are established in bridge components by feature dependence

        paper presents a comprehensive water quality monitoring system that employs
        a smart network management, nano-enriched sensing framework, and intelligent
        and efficient data analysis and forwarding protocols for smart and system-aware
        decision making. The presented system comprises two main subsystems, a data
        sensing and forwarding subsystem (DSFS), and Operation Management Subsystem
        (OMS). The OMS operates based on real-time learned patterns and rules of system
        operations projected from the DSFS to manage the entire network of sensors.
        The main tasks of OMS are to enable real-time data visualization, managed
        system control, and secure system operation. The DSFS employs a Hybrid Intelligence
        (HI) scheme which is proposed through integrating an association rule learning
        algorithm with<jats:italic>fuzzy<\/jats:italic>logic and weighted decision
        trees. The DSFS operation is based on profiling and registering raw data readings,
        generated from a set of optical nanosensors, as profiles of attribute-value
        pairs. As a case study, we evaluate our implemented test bed via simulation
        scenarios in a water quality monitoring framework. The monitoring processes

        paper proposes an efficient method for joint power and subcarrier allocation
        in a multicell multiuser OFDMA downlink network. The joint optimization problem
        is formulated with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency subject
        to the constraints on the quality of service in sum transmission rates for
        each cell and the total transmit power for the network. Due to intercell cochannel
        interferences and multiple variable coupling, the problem is intractable in
        its original form. To relax the difficulties in coordinating cochannel interferences,
        we introduce the tolerable interferences constraints for interference channels.
        To cope with the multiple variable coupling, we decompose the joint optimization
        problem into two iterative processes of user scheduling and a parametric convex
        optimization problem, where the energy efficiency is treated as the parameter
        and approached by bisection search. Then, by double dual decomposition, the
        parametric convex problem is transformed into Lagrangian dual problems at
        two levels of cells and subcarriers, and a decentralized solution is obtained
        in closed form. Based on the reformulations, an iterative subgradient algorithm
        is presented for approaching the joint optimization problem with acceptable
        complexity. Computer simulations are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm
        and examine the effects of various system parameters.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2018\/6875090","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,30]],"date-time":"2018-10-30T19:31:33Z","timestamp":1540927893000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Lagrangian

        Our study documented that dCA is impaired in patients with epilepsy, especially
        in those with interictal slow wave. The impairment of dCA occurs irrespective
        of the discharge location and type. Interictal slow wave is an independent
        factor to predict impaired dCA in patients with epilepsy.<jats:italic> Clinical

        Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem.
        It is usually modelled in a static fashion; however, in practice, new requests
        by customers arrive after the initial workday plan is in progress. In this
        case, routes must be replanned dynamically. This paper investigates the Dynamic
        Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (DVRPTW) in which customers\u2019
        requests either can be known at the beginning of working day or occur dynamically
        over time. We propose a hybrid heuristic algorithm that combines the harmony
        search (HS) algorithm and the Variable Neighbourhood Descent (VND) algorithm.
        It uses the HS to provide global exploration capabilities and uses the VND
        for its local search capability. In order to prevent premature convergence
        of the solution, we evaluate the population diversity by using entropy. Computational
        results on the Lackner benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm
        is competitive with the best existing algorithms from the literature.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2017\/1021432","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,28]],"date-time":"2017-11-28T23:30:23Z","timestamp":1511911823000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["A

        paper represents an efficient technique for neural network modeling of flight

        model and will help to minimize the number of neurons. For linear flight\/space
        dynamics systems, the technique can find the network weights and biases directly
        by solving a system of linear equations without the need for training. Nonlinear
        flight dynamic systems can be easily modeled by training its linearized models
        keeping the same network structure. The training is fast, as it uses the linear
        system knowledge to speed up the training process. The technique is tested

        drilling is low cost and effectively improves the penetration rate and causes
        minimal damage to liquid-sensitive pay zones. However, there is a potential
        downhole explosion when combustible gas mixed with drilling fluid reaches
        the combustible condition. In this paper, based on the underground combustion
        mechanism, an explosive range calculation model is established. This model
        couples the state equation and the empirical formula method, which considers
        the inert gas content, pressure, mixed gas component, and temperature. The
        result shows that increase of the inert gas content narrows the explosive
        range, while increase of the gas temperature and pressure improves the explosive
        range. A case in Chongqing, China, is used to validate the explosive range
        calculation model.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2016\/6032587","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,5]],"date-time":"2016-01-05T16:04:50Z","timestamp":1452009890000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["An

        approach of representing meanings of images based on associative values with

        that reflects the tolerance degree between defined lexicons is generated,
        and two factors of semantic relevance (SR) and visual similarity (VS) are
        involved in generating associative values. Furthermore, the algorithm of calculating
        associative values using pixel-based bidirectional associative memories (BAMs)
        in combination with the STRM, which is easy in implementation, is depicted.

        manner. A user can be an online shopper or a social media user, exposed to
        digital interventions produced by machine learning algorithms. A user preference
        can be anything from inclination towards a product to a political party affiliation.
        Our framework uses a state-space model to represent user preferences as latent
        system parameters which can only be observed indirectly via online user actions
        such as a purchase activity or social media status updates, shares, blogs,
        or tweets. Based on these observations, machine learning algorithms produce
        digital interventions such as targeted advertisements or tweets. We model
        the effects of these interventions through a causal feedback loop, which alters

        After the introduction of CER quantitative and sustainable mechanism, the
        amount of CER that can enter the market was cut to a quarter, which reduces
        about 75% of the expected CER supply. Market CER from the technology types
        of higher CER market share and lower support for sustainable development appears
        to have different degrees of reduction. As for the technology types of lower
        CER market share and higher support for sustainable development, the amount
        of market CER is maintained in line with prevailing scenario, and market CER
        supply becomes more balanced.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2015\/765472","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,7]],"date-time":"2015-06-07T17:02:43Z","timestamp":1433696563000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Study

        Nineteen head-injured patients with evidence of refractory intracranial hypertension
        and transtentorial herniation were prospectively studied. Cerebral hemodynamic
        assessment by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography was performed prior
        to decompressive craniectomy. Patients and their cerebral hemispheres were
        classified according to TCD-hemodynamic patterns, and the data correlated
        with neurological status, midline shift on CT scan, and Glasgow outcome scale
        scores at 6 months after injury.<jats:italic>Results<\/jats:italic>. A wide
        variety of cerebral hemodynamic findings were observed. Ten patients (52.7%)
        presented with cerebral oligoemia, 3 patients (15.8%) with cerebral hyperemia,
        and 6 patients with nonspecific circulatory pattern. Circulatory disturbances
        were more frequently found in the side of maximal cerebral swelling than in
        the opposite side. Pulsatility index (PI) values suggested that ICP varied
        from acceptable to considerably high; patients with increased PI, indicating
        higher microvascular resistance. No correlation was found between cerebral

        objective of this paper is to present a short research about the overall broadband
        penetration in Greece. In this research, a new empirical deterministic model
        is proposed for the short-term forecast of the cumulative broadband adoption.
        The fitting performance of the model is compared with some widely used diffusion
        models for the cumulative adoption of new telecommunication products, namely,
        Logistic, Gompertz, Flexible Logistic (FLOG), Box-Cox, Richards, and Bass
        models. The fitting process is done with broadband penetration official data
        for Greece. In conclusion, comparing these models with the empirical model,
        it could be argued that the latter yields well enough statistics indicators
        for fitting and forecasting performance. It also stresses the need for further
        research and performance analysis of the model in other more mature broadband

        aim of this study is to further investigate the effect of different basalt
        fiber (BF) factors on the viscoelastic equivalent creep behavior of fiber-reinforced
        asphalt mixture (FRAM) under indirect tensile (IDT) condition. A two-dimension
        mesostructural model composed of different components including fiber mortar
        polymer and coarse particle aggregate is constructed via the section image
        processing for the IDT FRAM specimen, where BF is considered as random distribution
        in the mortar polymer. Furthermore, the stress distribution and equivalent
        creep of the IDT mesostructural model in simulation software are analyzed
        to discuss the influence of components on the creep behavior of FRAM. Moreover,
        the laboratory creep test of IDT specimens under 0% and 0.3% BF contents for
        FRAM is carried out to validate the simulated values. Research results indicate
        that the simulated creep deformation of the IDT mesostructural model is in
        agreement with that of the experiment. Finally, creep simulations are further
        conducted to discuss the effect of BF (e.g., fiber content, length-diameter
        ratio, and fiber modulus) and aggregate on the creep characteristic of FRAM.
        The increase of fiber content and length-diameter ratio has a significant
        reinforcing effect on the equivalent mechanical behavior, but the change in
        the modulus of fiber and aggregate has slight effects.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6682606","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,18]],"date-time":"2021-02-18T01:52:32Z","timestamp":1613613152000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Viscoelastic

        levels of the tumor marker CA19-9 have been reported to be elevated in patients

        HCC and having preoperative CA19-9 data was enrolled in this study. Serum
        CA19-9 levels were correlated with clinicopathologic factors. Univariate and

        this paper, a recognition model based on the improved hybrid particle swarm

        improve the efficiency of radar working state recognition. First, the model
        improves the HPSO algorithm through the nonlinear decreasing inertia weight
        by adding the deceleration factor and asynchronous learning factor. Then,
        the BP neural network\u2019s initial weights and thresholds are optimised
        to overcome the shortcomings of slow convergence rate and falling into local
        optima. In the simulation experiment, improved HPSO-BP recognition models
        were established based on the datasets for three radar types, and these models
        were subsequently compared to other recognition models. The results reveal
        that the improved HPSO-BP recognition model has better prediction accuracy
        and convergence rate. The recognition accuracy of different radar types exceeded
        97%, which demonstrates the feasibility and generalisation of the model applied

        paper is concerned with the state estimation problem for a class of time-delay
        systems with Markovian jump parameters and missing measurements, considering
        the fact that data missing may occur in the process of transmission and its
        failure rates are governed by random variables satisfying certain probabilistic
        distribution. By employing a new Lyapunov function and using the convexity
        property of the matrix inequality, a sufficient condition for the existence
        of the desired state estimator for Markovian jump systems with missing measurements
        can be achieved by solving some linear matrix inequalities, which can be easily
        facilitated by using the standard numerical software. Furthermore, the gain

        order to solve the dynamic vibration characteristics of the power-split transmission
        system, the system of the dynamic mechanical model is established. Firstly,
        according to the theoretical analysis method of the tooth contact analysis
        (TCA) and loaded tooth contact analysis (LTCA), the actual meshing process
        of each gear pair is simulated, and the time-varying mesh stiffness excitation
        is obtained, which can improve the numerical precision. Next, by using the
        lumped mass method, the bending-torsional coupling three-dimensional dynamical
        model of the power-split transmission is established. The identical dimensionless
        equations are deduced by eliminating the effect of rigid displacement and
        the method of dimensional normalization. Next, the frequency domain and time
        domain responses of this system are obtained. The dynamic load change characteristics
        of each gear pair are analyzed. The results show that establishment, solution,
        and analysis of the system dynamics model could provide a basis for the dynamic
        design and have an important significance for the dynamic efficiency analysis
        and dynamic performance optimization design of the power-split transmission.

        airspace is sectorized according to some predefined rules that are not flexible.
        To facilitate utilizing the airspace more efficiently, methods to design sectors
        need to be promoted. In this paper, we propose an undirected graph cut-based
        approach that employs a memetic local search-embedded constrained evolution
        algorithm, NSGA-II, to generate nondominated airspace configurations. We also
        propose a new concave hull-based method to automatically depict sector boundaries.
        In addition, we also study the configuration transition problem. We define
        the similarity of the two different configurations and calculate their similarity
        with a bisection diagram and a minimum cost flow algorithm. We build a forward
        network to represent configuration transitions across several consecutive
        time periods and use multiobjective dynamic programming to determine a series
        of nondominated configuration links from the first period to the end. We test
        our approaches by simulation in high-altitude airspace controlled by Beijing
        Area Control Center. The results show that our sectorization method outperforms
        the current configuration in practice, providing a lower sector number, lower
        intersector flow, more balanced workload distribution among the different
        sectors, and no constraint violations, so that the proposed approach shows
        its significant potential as practical applications for dynamic airspace configuration.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2016\/6048326","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,28]],"date-time":"2016-06-28T13:18:06Z","timestamp":1467119886000},"page":"1-21","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Sectorization

        recent years, it has been documented that climatic variability influences
        hydrological processes; however, these influences, such as hydrologic dynamics,
        have not yet been incorporated into models, which have been assumed as stationary
        with regard to climatic conditions. In this study, the temporal variability
        of hydrological processes and their influence on the water balance of a mountainous
        and data-sparse catchment in Chile are observed and modeled through the comparison
        of a stationary (time-invariant parameters) and dynamic (time-variant parameters)
        model. Since conceptual models are the most adequate option for a data-scarce
        basin, a conceptual model integrated with the Monte Carlo Analysis Toolbox
        is used to perform the analyses. Simple analyses aimed at increasing the amount
        of information obtained from models were used. The General and Dynamic Identifiability
        Analyses were used to perform stationary and dynamic calibration strategies,
        respectively. As a result we concluded that the dynamic model is more robust
        than the stationary one. Additionally, DYNIA helped us to observe the temporal
        variability of hydrological processes. This analysis contributed to a better
        understanding of hydrological processes in a data-sparse Andean catchment
        and thus could potentially help reduce uncertainties in the outputs of hydrological
        models under scenarios of climate change and\/or variability.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2015\/526158","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,2]],"date-time":"2015-11-02T21:03:44Z","timestamp":1446498224000},"page":"1-14","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Comparison

        degradation in the form of soil erosion and fertility depletion is the major
        environmental problem in Ethiopia. However, to curb this problem, soil and
        water conservation (SWC) structures are commonly practiced in many rural parts
        of Ethiopia. This study was conducted to assess the effects of SWC structures
        on selected soil physicochemical properties in Ejersa Lafo district. For this
        study, two kebeles (peasant associations) were selected purposively from the
        district based on the severity of soil erosion and information on SWC practices.
        The research design employed in this study was systematic, randomized, complete
        block design. A total of 12 composite soil samples were collected from the
        depth of 0 to 20\u2009cm at two subwatersheds, namely, Jamjam laga batu and
        Koriso Odo guba with SWC and without SWC structures at three landscape positions.
        All the soil samples were analyzed following the standard and recommended
        procedures. The effect of independent variables (SWC practices and landscape
        positions) on the dependent variables (soil properties) was statistically
        tested using the SPSS computer program 21. In this study, most of the selected
        soil physicochemical properties were affected by watershed management intervention
        (SWC) structures. Soil moisture content (SMC), clay, pH, electrical conductivity
        (EC), total N (TN), available (AP), available K (AK), and organic carbon (OC)
        were higher in the subwatershed treated with SWC structures (conserved), whereas
        bulk density, silt, and sand were higher in the subwatershed without SWC structures
        (nonconserved). Most of the selected soil chemical properties were significantly
        varied (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        between conserved and nonconserved farm land except EC. All the selected soil
        physicochemical properties did not show any significant variation (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math
        xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M2\">\n                        <mi>p<\/mi>\n                        <mo>&lt;<\/mo>\n                        <mn>0.05<\/mn>\n                     <\/math>\n                  <\/jats:inline-formula>)
        at landscape positions except sandy soil. The physicochemical soil properties
        of selected parameters were in good conditions in the conserved areas with
        higher N and OM and lower BD, indicating fertility of the soil compared with
        the nonconserved land. The implementation of SWC structures improved some
        of the physicochemical properties of soil, such as SMC, clay particle, pH,
        EC, total N, AP, AK, and OC in the study area. Furthermore, efforts are required
        to enhance community adoption towards soil and water conservation. Additionally,
        further research has to be carried out on socioeconomic aspects and impacts
        of the intervention on crop productivity for better understanding of the sustainable
        use of the land.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/9910237","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,23]],"date-time":"2021-06-23T19:05:10Z","timestamp":1624475110000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effects

        PMNs in response to<jats:italic>Plasmodium falciparum<\/jats:italic>-parasitized
        erythrocytes (iRBCs) by using oligonucleotide microarrays. Results revealed
        that PMNs induced a broad and vigorous set of changes in gene expression in
        response to malarial parasites, represented by 118 upregulated and 216 downregulated
        genes. The transcriptional response was characterized by the upregulation
        of numerous genes encoding multiple surface receptors, proteins involved in
        signal transduction pathways, and defense response proteins. This response
        included a number of genes which are known to be involved in the pathogenesis
        of malaria and other inflammatory diseases. Gene enrichment analysis suggested
        that the biological pathways involved in the PMN responses to the iRBCs included
        insulin receptor, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase
        (MAPK), and interleukin and interferon-gamma (IFN-<jats:italic>\u03b3<\/jats:italic>)

        present a unique case of a 16-year-old male patient who was eventually diagnosed

        had caused intermittent intestinal symptoms for three years before resulting
        in small bowel obstruction requiring surgical intervention. Meckel\u2019s
        enterolith ileus is very rare with only few cases described in the literature.
        To our knowledge, this is only the second case of Meckel\u2019s enterolith
        which had caused intermittent symptoms over a period of time, before resulting
        in ileus, and the first case where the intermittent symptoms lasted several
        years before bowel obstruction. The patient had been evaluated with colonoscopy,
        computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging enterography
        (MRIE); a calcified pelvic mass had been found, but no further diagnosis other
        than calcification was established. The patient presented at our emergency
        department, with symptoms of obstructive ileus and underwent exploratory laparotomy,
        where a large enterolith arising from a Meckel\u2019s diverticulum (MD) was
        identified, causing the obstruction. A successful partial enterectomy, enterolith

        relieved from his long-standing symptoms. Consequently, complications of Meckel\u2019s

        study examines the macroeconomic effects of investment policies aimed at extending
        the life of expressways in Japan based on a stochastic Ramsey model. The results
        of numerical analysis suggest that the benefits of life-extension investment
        in expressways can be increased by raising the level of maintenance intensity
        of expressways. The benefits of life-extension investment in expressways can
        be decomposed into the stock effect and the smoothing effect. Decomposition
        of life-extension benefits shows that the contribution of the stock effect
        is more than 90 percent, while that of the smoothing effect is less than 10
        percent. The implementation of life-extension investment policies regarding
        expressways offers advantages in terms of reducing economic fluctuations and
        user charges. In addition, if relative risk aversion is high, efficiency is
        low and intergenerational equity is high. Furthermore, a higher level of technology

        We report two cases of shock induced by mural intestinal hematoma in patients

        Patients were admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal tract bleeding associated

        Gastrointestinal bleeding associated with shock in patients treated by oral

        Colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a complex operation.
        Effective traction is crucial. We have successfully used an orthodontic rubber
        band (ORB) combined with the clip traction method to assist ESD (ORB-ESD).
        The aim of this retrospective study is to describe the method and to compare
        the efficacy and safety of ORB-ESD versus conventional ESD in the treatment
        of superficial colorectal tumors. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the

        Korean medical doctors who are treating infertility often use herbal medicine
        to promote implantation. In this article, as one of the research works on
        modernization of Traditional Korean Medicine, we investigated the experimental

        complications continue to be a major cause of morbidity after split-liver
        transplantation (SLT). In this report we describe an uncommon late biliary
        complication. One year after SLT the patient showed an intrahepatic bile dicy
        dilatation with severe cholangitis episodes. The segmentary bile duct of hepatic
        segment VI-VII draining in the left duct was unidentified and tied at the
        time of the in situ split-liver procedure. We perform a permanent obliteration
        of the dilated intrahepatic ducts by a percutaneous embolization using an
        n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NABC). The management of biliary complications after
        SLT requires a multidisciplinary approach. The use of NBCA in obliteration
        of a dilated bile duct seems to be a safe procedure with good results providing
        a less invasive option than hepatic resection and decreasing the morbidity
        associated with chronic external biliary drainage. Further studies are needed
        to determine whether this approach is effective and safe and whether it could
        reduce hospital stay and cost.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2009\/824803","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2009,6,24]],"date-time":"2009-06-24T13:17:21Z","timestamp":1245849441000},"page":"1-3","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Percutaneous

        of the latch part mechanism of the hood system. After briefly introducing
        the working principle of the AHLS operated by the gunpowder actuator, the
        governing equations of the AHLS are formulated for each different deploying

        distances such as the distance from the rotational center of the pop-up guide
        to the point of the latch in the axial and vertical directions. Then, a comparison
        is made of the total response time to completely deploy the hood lift system
        with the existing conventional AHLS and proposed AHLS. In addition, the workable

        (DPHC), a type of phlorotannin isolated from the marine alga Ishige okamurae,
        reportedly alleviates impaired glucose tolerance. However, the molecular mechanisms
        of DPHC regulatory activity and by which it exerts potential beneficial effects
        on glucose transport into skeletal myotubes to control glucose homeostasis
        remain largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect
        of DPHC on cytosolic Ca2+ levels and its correlation with blood glucose transport
        in skeletal myotubes in vitro and in vivo. Cytosolic Ca2+ levels upon DPHC
        treatment were evaluated in skeletal myotubes and zebrafish larvae by Ca2+
        imaging using Fluo-4. We investigated the effect of DPHC on the blood glucose
        level and glucose transport pathway in a hyperglycemic zebrafish. DPHC was
        shown to control blood glucose levels by accelerating glucose transport; this
        effect was associated with elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels in skeletal myotubes.
        Moreover, the increased cytosolic Ca2+ level caused by DPHC can facilitate
        the Glut4\/AMPK pathways of the skeletal muscle in activating glucose metabolism,
        thereby regulating muscle contraction through the regulation of expression
        of troponin I\/C, CaMKII, and ATP. Our findings provide insights into the
        mechanism of DPHC activity in skeletal myotubes, suggesting that increased
        cytosolic Ca2+ levels caused by DPHC can promote glucose transport into skeletal
        myotubes to modulate blood glucose levels, thus indicating the potential use
        of DPHC in the prevention of diabetes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/8893679","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,11]],"date-time":"2021-02-11T10:47:27Z","timestamp":1613040447000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Ca2+-Dependent

        defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age,
        is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. Characterizing anemia as microcytic
        and normocytic depends on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which is an important
        parameter in differentiating many types of anemia. Microcytic anemia due to
        iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. In this study,
        we aimed to assess the Mentzer index used by the Ministry of Health (MOH)
        in Palestine as a useful tool in differentiating between iron deficiency anemia
        (IDA) and thalassemia. We assessed for the prevalence of IDA among infants
        at the age of one year visiting the mother centers from seven West Bank provinces
        in Palestine. Medical records and hematology laboratory data of 3262 infants
        were retrospectively analyzed from the years of 2018 to 2020. The Mentzer
        index applied to all population by dividing mean corpuscular volume (MCV,
        in fL) by the red blood cell count (RBC, in millions per microliter). A corrected
        Mentzer index was further calculated among anemic infants to include only
        microcytic (MCV with less than 72\u2009fl) and hypochromic (mean corpuscular
        hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) with less than 32\u2009g\/L) indices. Mentzer
        index calculations for the whole population showed that 29.1% were anemic
        (hemoglobin (HGB) less than 11\u2009g\/dl): 21.1% had mild anemia, 7.6% had
        moderate anemia, while 0.2% had severe anemia. The corrected Mentzer index
        calculations showed a prevalence of 5.9% and 3.2% among IDA and thalassemia
        infants, respectively. Severity of anemia was correlated with low body weight
        and infants born through cesarean mother birth with no interference with gender
        influence. CBC indices of RBC count, HGB, MCV, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin
        (MCH) showed a significant difference (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        introduced a new CBC index among infants at the age of 1 year in Palestine.
        These lab references could aid in differentiating IDA and thalassemia among
        the population and improve initial diagnosis screenings. The Mentzer index
        calculation for the whole population did not necessarily include cases of
        IDA, and therefore, it is recommended to comprise microcytic and hypochromic

        intersection collision warning system (ICWS) is an emerging technology designed
        to assist drivers in avoiding collisions at intersections. ICWS has an excellent
        performance in reducing the number of collisions and improving driving safety.
        Previous studies demonstrated that when visibility was low under fog conditions,
        ICWS could help drivers timely detect hazardous conflicting vehicles. However,
        the influences of ICWS on interactive driving behavior at unsignalized intersection
        between different vehicles have barely been discussed. This study aimed to
        investigate the patterns of drivers\u2019 interactive behaviors with the assistance
        of a new kind of ICWS under fog conditions based on Multiuser Driving Simulation.
        The Multiuser Driving Simulation allowed multiple drivers to operate in the
        same simulation scenario at the same time, and it could capture drivers\u2019
        interactions preferably. Forty-eight licensed drivers completed the driving
        simulation experiment in three fog conditions (no fog, light fog, and heavy
        fog) and two warning conditions (warning and no warning), in which the drivers
        drove in a straight-moving situation at unsignalized intersection with potential
        collision risks caused by the encounter of two vehicles. The results verified
        that warning and fog conditions were significant factors that affected the
        interactive driving behavior in the unsignalized intersection collision avoidance
        process, including the driver\u2019s decision, TTC of action point, average
        acceleration (deceleration) rate, and postencroachment time. Compared to conditions
        without ICWS, the ICWS could help drivers make collision avoidance actions
        earlier and change the speed more smoothly. In addition, with the help of
        Multiuser Driving Simulation, associations between decision driving behaviors
        of vehicles were discussed with caution. The results revealed the decision-making
        mechanism of drivers in the process of interaction with other drivers. Under
        the influence of fog, interactive driving processes were fraught with increased
        risk at unsignalized intersection. However, the ICWS helped drivers interact
        more harmoniously, safely, and efficiently. The findings shed some light on
        the further development of ICWS and the study on interactive driving behavior.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/8871875","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,30]],"date-time":"2020-12-30T19:05:22Z","timestamp":1609355122000},"page":"1-16","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Effect

        of the hives were made from hollow tree logs (40%), tree barks (12%), banana
        leaves\/bark (11%), cow dung (8%), mud (7%), grass (6%), tree leaves (6%),
        and the rest (20%) were improved beehives, particularly Langstroth hives.
        The hive pests encountered were hive beetles (25%), small black ants (19%),
        wax moths (12%), lizards (8%), termites (7%), birds (6%), mites (3%), and
        mice (2%). Fifty-five percent of the respondents hung their hives on trees
        to prevent pest invasion with 95% effectiveness, 25% frequently smoked their
        hives with 85% effectiveness, 16% cleared the bushes around apiaries with
        55% effectiveness, and 4% used traditional plant insect repellents with 35%
        effectiveness. Forty-one percent of the respondents lacked adequate information
        on beekeeping, 25% had inadequate time to work on apiaries, 24% had inadequate
        technical knowledge and implements, and 10% needed additional labour for managing
        apiaries. Based on the results of this study, beekeeping in Kayonza is still
        largely traditional, characterized by the use of antiquated production methods
        and underutilization of available marketing channels. Perceptions in the district
        are that beekeeping is for the poor and illiterate. Challenges and limitations
        of beekeeping in Kayonza District include lack of education, gender bias,
        pests and diseases, absconding and swarming of bees, high costs, and lack
        of modern apicultural equipment. However, the potential for developing beekeeping
        enterprise (opportunities) is immense given the abundance of wild bee populations,
        possibility of women participation, abundance of honey collection centres
        (market), and availability of technical support from Government and development
        agencies. In conclusion, this study advocates the need for intervention measures
        to educate and promote production and marketing of quality honey, tackle pest
        and disease for beekeepers and boost Rwanda\u2019s apiculture industry.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/5982931","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]],"date-time":"2019-05-22T23:38:02Z","timestamp":1558568282000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Characterization

        stainless steels (DSSs) often have bad hot workability. In this study, specimens
        of 2205 DSS were hot tensioned over a strain rate range from 0.005\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>
        to 50\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup> to examine the hot ductility. The
        crack morphology was observed, and the dependence of hot ductility on the
        strain rate was analyzed. From 0.005\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup> to
        0.5\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>, both the total elongation and the
        reduction in area increased with the strain rate. The reduction in area exhibited
        a small decrease when the strain rate was greater than 0.5\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>.
        More than 85% of cracks formed between the ferrite and austenite, and no less
        than 70% of crack tips propagated between the ferrite and austenite. When
        the strain rate was increased from 0.005\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>
        to 0.5\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>, dynamic recrystallization was
        promoted in the austenite, and the number fraction of low-angle grain boundaries
        in the ferrite was improved. The higher strain rate reduced the difference
        between ferrite and austenite in hardness, which improved the hot ductility.
        For 2205 DDS, the suggested strain rate is 0.5\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>
        and above to avoid surface and edge cracking during hot forging or hot rolling.

        including potential clinical treatments of neural dysregulation. The zebrafish,<jats:italic>Danio
        rerio<\/jats:italic>, is an important vertebrate model system. We focused
        on the<jats:italic>grin1b<\/jats:italic>gene of zebrafish due to its important
        function in the nervous tissue as a glutamate receptor. Using a comparative
        sequence-based approach, we located possible RNA editing events within the<jats:italic>grin1b<\/jats:italic>transcript.
        Surprisingly, sequence analysis also revealed a new editing site which was
        not predicted by the comparative approach. We here report the discovery of
        two novel RNA editing events in<jats:italic>grin1b<\/jats:italic>transcripts
        of embryonic zebrafish. The frequency of these editing events and their locations
        within the<jats:italic>grin1b<\/jats:italic>transcript are also described.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2012\/173728","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,2,27]],"date-time":"2012-02-27T21:01:28Z","timestamp":1330376488000},"page":"1-7","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Identification
