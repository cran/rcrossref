rcrossref 0.3.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* New function `extract_pdf()` to extract text from pdfs
* New function `cr_ft_links()` to get links for full text content of an article (#10)
* New function `cr_ft_text()` to get links for full text content of an article. In addition,
`cr_ft_pdf()`, `cr_ft_plain()`, and `cr_ft_xml()` are convenience functions that will get
the format pdf, plain text, or xml, respectively. You can of course specify format in the 
`cr_ft_text()` function with the `type` parameter (#10) (#42)

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Filled out more tests (#45)

BUG FIXES

* No longer assign queried doi to the `data.frame` in `cr_works()`, which caused failure if
a non-Crossref DOI included (#52)
* `pmid2doi()` and `doi2pmid()` functions removed temporarily as the web service is down 
temporarily, but will be online again soon from Crossref (#48)
