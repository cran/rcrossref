\title{Defunct functions in rcrossref}
\description{
These functions are gone, no longer available.
}
\details{
\itemize{
 \item \code{\link{cr_citation}}: Crossref is trying to sunset their OpenURL API, which 
 this function uses. So this function is now removed. See the function \code{\link{cr_cn}}, 
 which does the same things, but with more functionality, using the new Crossref API.
 \item \code{\link{pmid2doi}} and \code{\link{doi2pmid}}: The API behind these functions
 is down for good, see \code{\link{id_converter}} for similar functionality.
